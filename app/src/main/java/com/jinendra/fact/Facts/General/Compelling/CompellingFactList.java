            "#965 How to classify the platypus, a native of Australia and Tasmania, is a problem that has puzzled biologists and zoologists since the animal was discovered in the eighteenth century. This strange animal has characteristics of both mammals and birds. For instance, the platypus lays eggs, as birds do. Yet platypus mothers nurse their young, a typical mammalian characteristic. (However, the platypus has no nipples. The mother secrets milk from stomach glands and the baby laps it up.) The platypus has a leathery, duck like bill (from which it gets the name “duck billed platypus”), and its feet are webbed like those of aquatic birds. Bu at the end of the webs are claws just like a cat's or a racoon's. After much argument, scientists finally decided that the platypus merited classification as a mammal—but only marginally.",
